ASSIGNMENT 1 NOTES

in order to print out a char frm 0-9 u have to static cast the char to an unsigned int, using:

	cout << static_cast<unsigned_int>(nine) << endl;

	or you can change it to an unsigned char by adding '0'

	cout << static_cast<unsigned_char>(nine + '0') << endl;

uint8_t is the exact same thing as using an unsigned char;

once you change ubigvalue_t to ubig_value, uvalue is undeclared, so you can delete : uvalue (that) frmo your methods

leave operator/ and operator% as is

to surpress unused parameter warnings use (void) variable

for multiply x2 you add the carry after u multiply, go left to right (least sig to most sig)

for divide /2 you divide by 2, and if the next digit is odd you add 5, go left to right (least sig to most sig)

write a loop that iterates through each digit using /10 and %/10

iterators of containers
	begin()
	end()
	cbegin(), cend()
	crbegin(), crend()
	rbegin(), rend()

	EX: auto iter = that.begin();
		cout << *iter << endl;

	the end iterator is an invalid value
